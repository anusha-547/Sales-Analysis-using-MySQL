# ${\color{red}Sales\ Analysis\ using \MySQL}$.
# 🏁 Objective
- Perform SQL-based analysis on a sales dataset to uncover trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

- Extract actionable insights to assist business decision-making.

# 🛠️ Tools Used
- SQL (Structured Query Language)

- Relational Database Management System (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

📝 Steps Included
- Database and Table Setup – (Assumed: COMPANY database with sales table).

Querying Data using SQL:

- Filtering sales based on shipping mode, category, country, and customer name.

- Text-based pattern searches (e.g., customer names starting with 'J' and ending with 'n').

- Date-based filtering (e.g., post-2020 sales in Ireland).

Aggregations:

- Total and average sales metrics.

- Grouping by city, customer, and product for deeper insights.

Advanced SQL Features:

- Ranking products by total sales using RANK() window function.

- Pagination (e.g., 10 records per page).

# 🔍 Analysis Included
- Top 5 cities by sales.

- Top 10 most profitable products.

- Customer order frequency analysis.

- Revenue, unit cost, and order count metrics.

- Text-based filtering: product names containing specific words (e.g., "Acco").

# 🌟 Key Insights
- Identified high-revenue cities and top-selling products.

- Noted specific customer patterns and order behaviors.

- Analyzed sales distribution across categories and geographies.

- Highlighted specific product trends (e.g., those with "Acco" in names).

# 📝 Conclusion
- This project demonstrates the power of SQL in extracting meaningful business insights from raw sales data. The queries cover filtering, aggregation, ranking, and text analysis, providing a foundation for more complex data exploration.
